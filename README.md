## Hi there 👋


I'm Steven Salazar and I'm a Software Engineering focusing on Cloud and Data Engineering. Currently, I am working with Google Cloud technologies, by designing and implementing Data Analytics architectures for our business users. 

The technologies that I usually use can vary depending on the business requirements, however, we always respect our Cybersecurity and Compliance policies, which sometimes can be difficult for a Financial entity.
